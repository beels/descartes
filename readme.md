# Descartes
Cartesian sequencer for norns, grid and crow. 

This is an implementation of Make Noise Rene v2 sequencer for norns, crow and grid. The script is intended to operate identical to Rene where possible - therefore I'm not going to write complete instructions about the operation of the script - but much can be gleaned by reading through the [Rene v2 manual](https://www.makenoisemusic.com/content/manuals/renemanual.pdf).

## Requirements
- norns
- grid
- crow

## Documentation
- Norns' screen indicates which parts of the grid correspond to which parameters of the sequencer.
- For access, gate, and glide, press keys on the grid to enable / disable behavior for a particular step.
- Hold a grid key in the step section and turn E2 to change the current note on that step.
- Go to params to map the various layers' cv and gate outputs to crows four outputs
